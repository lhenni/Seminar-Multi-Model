abstract="Domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) are designed to provide precise abstractions of domain-specific constructs. However, models for complex systems typically do not fit neatly within a single domain and capturing all important aspects of such a system requires developing multiple models using different DSMLs. Combining these models into multi-models presents difficult challenges, most importantly those of integrating the various models and keeping both the models and their associated data synchronized. To this end, we present NAOMI, an experimental platform for enabling multiple models, developed in different DSMLs, to work together. NAOMI analyzes model dependencies to determine the impact of changes to one model on other dependent models and coordinates the propagation of necessary model changes. NAOMI also serves as a useful testbed for exploring how diverse modeling paradigms can be combined.",
